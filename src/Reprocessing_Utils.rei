/*** Returns the Perlin noise value at specified coordinates. Perlin noise is a

  * procedural textures, shapes, terrains, and other seemingly organic forms.
  *
  * In contrast to the random() function, Perlin noise is defined in an infinite
  * n-dimensional space, in which each pair of coordinates corresponds to a
  * fixed semi-random value (fixed only for the lifespan of the program). The
  * resulting value will always be between 0.0 and 1.0. The noise value can be
  * animated by moving through the noise space.
  *
  * The actual noise structure is similar to that of an audio signal, in respect
  * to the function's use of frequencies. Similar to the concept of harmonics in
  * physics, Perlin noise is computed over several octaves which are added together
  * for the final result.
  *
  * Another way to adjust the character of the resulting sequence is the scale of
  * the input coordinates. As the function works within an infinite space, the
  * value of the coordinates doesn't matter as such; only the distance between
  * successive coordinates is important (such as when using noise() within a loop).
  * As a general rule, the smaller the difference between coordinates, the smoother the resulting noise sequence. Steps of 0.005-0.03 work best for most applications, but this will differ depending on use.
